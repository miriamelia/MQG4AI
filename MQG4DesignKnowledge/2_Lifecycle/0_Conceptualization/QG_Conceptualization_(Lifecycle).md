## Conceptualization (Lifecycle)

During *Conceptualization* the MQG4A template versions are filled with QGs and updated in alignment with iterations to establish an overview of the Lifecycle implementation and related *System* information:

1. Version 0 - configure template download version filled with MQG4DK information:
    - provides generally required high-risk information and best practices linked wihth *System*, and *Risk Management* information
    - contains selection of implementation approaches based on tags and an intelligent search in *Lifecycle*

2. Version 1 - *n* - create Quality Gates and link information between sections
    - fill all sections with project-specific information
    - gradually create new quality gates in *Lifecycle* and interdependencies outlining the AI system concept through implementing design decisions in alignment with concrete experiments and data 

3. Ideas for different MQG4A-versions are based on specific combinations of design decisions to monitor and link generated results with implemented concepts during development. They can be based on pre-, intra-, and post-selection versions for concrete design decision-making and the selection of the most suitable approach. 
Another approach could include template versions that provide conceptual information for the analysis of validation and verification objectives. For instance, regarding desirable criteria, such as *robustness* or *generalizability* through combinations of design decisions including results.
