### Definition Societal and Environmental Wellbeing
AI systems should benefit all human beings, including future generations. It must hence be ensured that they are sustainable and environmentally friendly. Moreover, they should take into account the environment, including other living beings, and their social and societal impact should be carefully considered.

#### Overview Requirements Societal and Environmental Wellbeing

##### Environmental Well-being
ALTAI
> - Are there potential negative impacts of the AI system on the environment?
>   - Which potential impact(s) do you identify?
> - Where possible, did you establish mechanisms to evaluate the environmental impact of the AI system’s development, deployment and/or use (for example, the amount of energy used and carbon emissions)?
>   - Did you define measures to reduce the environmental impact of the AI system throughout its lifecycle?
>> MQG4AI's design is intended to support this process through the provision of [addtional layer in the leaf Quality Gates](../../../../templates/Template_LeafQG.md) for relevant information extraction and evaluation in form of e.g. a sustainability layer

##### Impact on Work and Skills
ALTAI
> - Does the AI system impact human work and work arrangements?
> - Did you pave the way for the introduction of the AI system in your organisation by informing and consulting with impacted workers and their representatives (trade unions, (European) work councils) in advance?
> - Did you adopt measures to ensure that the impacts of the AI system on human work are well understood?
>   - Did you ensure that workers understand how the AI system operates, which capabilities it has and which it does not have?
> - Could the AI system create the risk of de-skilling of the workforce?
>   - Did you take measures to counteract de-skilling risks?
> - Does the system promote or require new (digital) skills?
>   - Did you provide training opportunities and materials for re- and up-skilling?

##### Impact on Society at large or Democracy
ALTAI
> - Could the AI system have a negative impact on society at large or democracy?
>   - Did you assess the societal impact of the AI system’s use beyond the (end-)user and subject, such as potentially indirectly affected stakeholders or society at large?
>   - Did you take action to minimize potential societal harm of the AI system?
>   - Did you take measures that ensure that the AI system does not negatively impact democracy?
