### Definition Diversity, Non-Discrimination and Fairness
Unfair bias must be avoided, as it could could have multiple negative implications, from the marginalization of vulnerable groups, to the exacerbation of prejudice and discrimination. Fostering diversity, AI systems should be accessible to all, regardless of any disability, and involve relevant stakeholders throughout their entire life circle.


#### Overview Requirements Diversity, Non-Discrimination and Fairness

##### Avoidance of Unfair Bias

ALTAI:
> - Did you establish a strategy or a set of procedures to avoid creating or reinforcing unfair bias in the AI system, both regarding the use of input data as well as for the algorithm design?
>> MQG4AI's design is intended to support this process through the inclusion of an [Ethics section for contributing stakeholders](../../../1_System/Application/Ethics/Ethics_Specific.md)
> - Did you consider diversity and representativeness of end-users and/or subjects in the data?
>   - Did you test for specific target groups or problematic use cases?
>   - Did you research and use publicly available technical tools, that are state-of-the-art, to improve your understanding of the data, model and performance?
>   - Did you assess and put in place processes to test and monitor for potential biases during the entire lifecycle of the AI system (e.g. biases due to possible limitations stemming from the composition of the used data sets (lack of diversity, non-representativeness))?
>   - Where relevant, did you consider diversity and representativeness of end-users and or subjects in the data?
> - Did you put in place educational and awareness initiatives to help AI designers and AI developers be more aware of the possible bias they can inject in designing and developing the AI system?
>> MQG4AI's design is intended to support this process through the inclusion of an [Ethics section for contributing stakeholders](../../../1_System/Application/Ethics/Ethics_Specific.md)
> - Did you ensure a mechanism that allows for the flagging of issues related to bias, discrimination or poor performance of the AI system?
>   - Did you establish clear steps and ways of communicating on how and to whom such issues can be raised?
>   - Did you identify the subjects that could potentially be (in)directly affected by the AI system, in addition to the (end-)users and/or subjects?
> - Is your definition of fairness commonly used and implemented in any phase of the process of setting up the AI system?
>   - Did you consider other definitions of fairness before choosing this one?
>   - Did you consult with the impacted communities about the correct definition of fairness, i.e. representatives of elderly persons or persons with disabilities?
>   - Did you ensure a quantitative analysis or metrics to measure and test the applied definition of fairness?
>   - Did you establish mechanisms to ensure fairness in your AI system?
>> MQG4AI's design is intended to support this process through the inclusion of an [Ethics section for contributing stakeholders](../../../1_System/Application/Ethics/Ethics_Specific.md)

##### Accessibility and Universal Design

ALTAI:
> - Did you ensure that the AI system corresponds to the variety of preferences and abilities in society?
> - Did you assess whether the AI system's user interface is usable by those with special needs or disabilities or those at risk of exclusion?
>   - Did you ensure that information about, and the AI system's user interface of, the AI system is accessible and usable also to users of assistive technologies (such as screen readers)?
>   - Did you involve or consult with end-users or subjects in need for assistive technology during the planning and development phase of the AI system?
> - Did you ensure that Universal Design principles are taken into account during every step of the planning and development process, if applicable?
> - Did you take the impact of the AI system on the potential end-users and/or subjects into account?
>   - Did you assess whether the team involved in building the AI system engaged with the possible target end-users and/or subjects?
>   - Did you assess whether there could be groups who might be disproportionately affected by the outcomes of the AI system?
>   - Did you assess the risk of the possible unfairness of the system onto the end-user's or subject's communities?

##### Stakeholder Participation

ALTAI:
> - Did you consider a mechanism to include the participation of the widest range of possible stakeholders in the AI systemâ€™s design and development?
