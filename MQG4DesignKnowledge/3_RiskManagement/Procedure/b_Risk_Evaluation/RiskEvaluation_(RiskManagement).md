### Risk Evaluation (RiskManagement)

Based on the risk analysis (risk identification + risk estimation), evaluate each estimated risk to determine if they are acceptable or not based on previously identified risk criteria as part of the risk management plan.

If the risk is acceptable, it counts as a residual risk (left after risk control) and communication to the user may suffice, as an example for the lowest risk mitigation procedure.

Otherwise, further risk controls need to be implemented.
