### Domain Experts (Consulting Stakeholder)
External groups and experts in the field are important to understand the intended domain:
Work with external groups and experts in the field to define benchmarks before implementation. Also work with external groups to continuously monitor performance from multiple perspectives after implementation.

##### Example [Multi-Label ECG classification in an emergency setting](../../Application/example_ECGAlarmingGuardFunctionality_(EmergencyMedicine).md):
An anesthetist was consulted to support the interpretation of [performance metrics](../../../2_Lifecycle/2_Development/2_Model_Evaluation/PerformanceMetrics/QG_PerformanceMetricsCompilation_(MultiLabelClassification).md) in the intended real world setting based on ECG domain knowledge. Especially, desirable [performance objectives](../../../2_Lifecycle/2_Development/2_Model_Evaluation/PerformanceMetrics/QG_Objective_(MultiLabelClassification).md) were defined for overall the model, and label-specific. 
Furhter, domain-embedded post-processing in form of a [benefit matrix](../../../2_Lifecycle/2_Development/3_Model_Optimization/PostProcessing/QG_BenefitMatrix_(MultiLabelClassification).md) was developed in cooperation.
