## Documentation (AIRO)

This section provides an overview of required documentation, and MQG4AI is intended to provide the required information, which needs to be extracted and transformed into document-format.
The [Lifecycle implementation](../../2_Lifecycle/AI_Lifecycle.md), as well as [AI risks](../../3_RiskManagement/AI_Risks/) define relevant information to fill documentation such as the instructions of use, or post-market monitoring information, for instance.
